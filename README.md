# CircuitBuilderGame

Author: Ty Brennan

This game is designed to be a creative circuit building sandbox for people who are interested in electrical engineering or computer engineering.

This game is partially inspired by the [NAND game](https://nandgame.com) and at-home circuit building kits.

You are initially given a small set of simple components, from which you can create anything. Abstractify your work into functional circuit-boards and chips to be reused in other projects.

I will try to optimize this project to the highest extent possible to allow for larger circuits.
